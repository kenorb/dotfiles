"""A tiny Python program to check that Python is working.
Try running this program from the command line like this:
  python hello.py
  python hello.py Alice
That should print:
  Hello World -or- Hello Alice
Try changing the 'Hello' to 'Howdy' and run again.
Once you have that working, you're ready for class -- you can edit
and run Python code; now you just need to learn Python!
